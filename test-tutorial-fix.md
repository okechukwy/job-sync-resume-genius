# Tutorial Content Display Fix Verification

## Issue Description
When users clicked the "Start Learning" or "Start Module" button in the Effective Communication Foundations module (and other learning modules), the tutorial content was not being displayed to the user.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `ModuleContentModal.tsx` file, specifically in the `isStarted` logic:

### Before Fix (Problematic Logic):
```typescript
const hasMeaningfulProgress = progressPercentage > 10;
const isStarted = progress?.status === 'completed' || hasMeaningfulProgress || hasCompletedSections;
```

### Problem:
- When `handleStart` was called, it set progress to 10% 
- But `hasMeaningfulProgress` required progress > 10 (greater than)
- This created a condition where progress was 10% but `isStarted` evaluated to false
- Result: Module appeared not started, tutorial content was hidden

## Fix Applied
Updated the logic to properly handle the "started" state:

### After Fix:
```typescript
const hasMeaningfulProgress = progressPercentage >= 10; // Changed from > to >=
const isStarted = progress?.status === 'completed' || progress?.status === 'in_progress' || hasMeaningfulProgress || hasCompletedSections;
```

### Changes Made:
1. Changed `progressPercentage > 10` to `progressPercentage >= 10`
2. Added explicit check for `progress?.status === 'in_progress'`
3. Updated comments to reflect that 10% progress counts as "started"

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. User clicks "Start Learning" or "Start Module" button
2. Module progress is set to 10% with status "in_progress"
3. `isStarted` evaluates to true because:
   - `progressPercentage >= 10` is true (10 >= 10)
   - `progress?.status === 'in_progress'` is true
4. Tutorial content is displayed in the ContentRenderer component
5. User can see learning materials (articles, interactive content, assessments)

## Files Modified
- `src/components/coaching/ModuleContentModal.tsx` (lines 80-85)

## Verification Steps
1. Navigate to Career Coaching Hub
2. Enroll in "Effective Communication Foundations" program  
3. Go to Learning tab and select the program
4. Click on any module to open the modal
5. Click "Start Learning" or "Start Module" button
6. Verify that tutorial content (Introduction, Main Video Content, Knowledge Check sections) is now visible
7. Verify progress tracker on the left shows current section
8. Verify content renders properly in the main content area

## Status: COMPLETED âœ…
The fix has been implemented and should resolve the tutorial content display issue.
